# CIFAR-10 Dataset Exploration and KNN Classification

This repository documents the journey of exploring the CIFAR-10 dataset and implementing a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for image classification tasks. CIFAR-10 is a popular dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

## Overview

1. **Dataset Loading and Exploration:**
   - Load the CIFAR-10 dataset and perform an initial exploration to understand its structure and content.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Prepare the dataset for training and testing, including data normalization and splitting into training and testing sets.

3. **Baseline Model:**
   - Implement a basic KNN classifier as a starting point.
   - Evaluate the baseline model's performance and accuracy.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Experiment with different hyperparameters for KNN, such as the number of neighbors (K), distance metrics, and weights.
   - Document the results and performance improvements obtained with each hyperparameter change.

5. **Data Augmentation:**
   - Apply data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training dataset.
   - Observe the impact of data augmentation on model accuracy.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the final KNN classifier's performance on the test dataset.
   - Report the achieved accuracy and discuss any challenges encountered
